# A/B Testing


This exercise is part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

The notebook includes A/B testing for an e-commerce website.
The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page,
keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
Data was provided by Udacity.
