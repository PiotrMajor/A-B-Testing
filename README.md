# A/B Testing by Piotr Majorkowski

The notebook includes A/B testing for an e-commerce website. The goal is to help a company understand if they should implement a new page in order to improve users' conversion rate to maximize revenue.

After performing an **A/B test** and **logistic regression**, I conclude the the company should not launch the new website as there is not enough evidence that the new version affects the users' conversion rate.
